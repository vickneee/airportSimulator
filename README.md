#How to use
In the simulation interface the user has the option to configure the simulation using the parameters given to the user including arrival time between passengers, amount of passengers traveling out of the EU, simulation time and delay (doesnt impact results).
The middle of the interface displays the current queues on service points and the right side of the interface displays the results of the simulation.
